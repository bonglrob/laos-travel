# Laos Travel

Laos is an absolutely stunning place to visit in Southeast Asia, rich in culture and food. The people are also so friendly and welcoming, so please visit!

This is an example site of a tourism landing page for Laos. This showcases my ability to work with HTML and CSS. My approach was to built the HTML structure first to have the proper layout and then building the design based on modern industry standards par to other landing sites. 

Semantic HTML is also used which is important two-fold:
1. Accessibilty
2. SEO

1. Accessibility
`<nav>` would allow for screen readers to detect navigation links easier and pass that information down to the end user.

2. Search Engine Optimization (SEO)
`<section>` would allow for web crawlers and indexers to easier parse the text content within a website, increasing the discoverability and higher rank within search engines. This is valuable for any business for search discoverability and driving more customer traffic to their site.
